vote_announcements.py — The chair's vote results, found in a transcript by code.
=================================================================================
"Motion passes 9 to2", "motion failed. 5 to six", "the motion carries
twenty-five to thirteen": when a chair announces a result with a tally, code
can find it without a model. Two uses:

  - summarize_meeting() lists them in the transcript prompt, so the summary's
    votes match what the chair said even where the model would have guessed
    (Sept. 8, 2026: the summary called the lead ordinance "Approved"; the
    chair said "Motion failed. 5 to six.");
  - audit_votes.py compares each transcript summary's votes against them.

Chairs say it many ways: "Motion passes 9 to2" (Oct. 13, 2026), "Vote passed 11
to zero", "and that passed 11 to zero", "Pass seven to four", and "Past 8 to
three", the captions' spelling of "passed" (July 14). What isn't a result:
  - a span of time: "over the past 3 to 5 years";
  - a vote recalled from elsewhere: "That passed five to zero at finance",
    "that did pass 4 to 1 at the arts commission", "it did pass 5 to 0 is
    what we have recorded".
Results announced without a tally ("motion carries") aren't found; nor are
bodies that don't say tallies aloud (Marathon County's board).
